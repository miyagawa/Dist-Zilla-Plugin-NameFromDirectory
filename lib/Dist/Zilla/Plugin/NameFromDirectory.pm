=head1 NAME

Dist::Zilla::Plugin::NameFromDirectory - Guess distribution name from the current directory

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  [NameFromDirectory]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Dist::Zilla::Plugin::NameFromDirectory is a Dist::Zilla plugin to
guess distribution name (when it's not set in C<dist.ini>) from the
current working directory.

Prefixes such as C<perl-> and C<p5->, as well as the postfix C<.pm>
and C<-pm> will be automatically trimmed. The following directory
names are all recognized as C<Foo-Bar>.

  Foo-Bar
  p5-Foo-Bar
  perl-Foo-Bar
  Foo-Bar-pm

It is designed to be used with Plugin bundle so that your dist.ini
doesn't need to contain per-project name anymore.

Even when this plugin is used, you can always override the name by
specifying it in C<dist.ini>.
